Amber: The Function Partner

"Don't just show me the graph. Tell me the story of gravity."
**Amber** is an AI agent designed to explain mathematical functions not via formulas, but through visual intuition.

### Purpose:
Most math tools show you *what* (e.g., Desmos graphs). Amber explains **why**.
- Why is x^2 a U-shape? (Because it's a ball thrown in the air).
- Why does sin(x) wave? (Because it's a circle unrolled over time).

### Tech Stack?
- **Core:** Python 3.10+
- **Brain:** OpenAI GPT something
- **Framework:** prob langgraph

### Roadmap (30-Day Build)
We are building this agent from scratch to learn the fundmentals of AI engineering.

- [x] Tier 1: The Chatter (Single-file connection to LLM)
- [x] Tier 2: The Architect (Basically broke it down in parts)
- [x] Tier 3: The Historian (Context/Memory Management)
- [ ] Tier 4: The Tool User (Calculator & Function Calling)
- [ ] Use langgraph
- [ ] Finish
- [ ] Test eh

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Add your API Key to `.env`:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run:
   python main.py

### Q&A:
Why?  
I want to use this to futher streghthen my schoolarship portfolio. Related to my statement "I want to help visual thinker like me"  
TF are you doing?  
Clone, break, learn how it works, recreate, move on, repeat until I know how raw AI agent works and not using framework is holding me back then use framework, finish the project, apply, win (maybe)
